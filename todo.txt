***The challenge***

Using your front-end skills, complete this front-end component that takes a JSON feed (simulated from our Content API (CAPI) data) and render a list of news articles.

**We want you to approach this challenge in the below order:**

* Scaffold a new project. e.g. create-react-app
* Add a headline, date, standfirst, thumbnail and link (canonical) for each story in the list
* Commit your changes to GIT (regular commits whilst developing is preferred.)
* Implement pagination
* Add some basic css to make it viewable.

If time permits:

* Add in unit testing
* Clean up the design

**Hints**

* Most of the data listed above is named accordingly in the json feed. 
* Thumbnail images are trickier and contain a reference id (related.thumbnail.default[0]). 
* This will need to be matched to the references object to get the image data and url (references.{id}.link.media)

**Rules**

You can research throughout the challenge
You can implement any framework/library/dependencies you feel are necessary. React is preferred.

Good luck!
